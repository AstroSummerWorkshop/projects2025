    "# Using Spectroscopy to Study Galaxies\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a Spectrum?\n",
    "Light, similar to sound, is energy that travels as a wave (a wave of electric and magnetic fields in the case of light). The *wavelength* of light just describes the distance between peaks in a traveling light wave. The figure below shows a wave with its wavelength labeled.\n",
    "\n",
    "![figure1](images/wavelength_6.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "It is rare for anything to emit light at just *one* wavelength, however. Almost everything that we see is made up of light at many different wavelengths. Let's imagine that we wanted to know how much light of each wavelength is being emitted by a light source, say the Sun. To accomplish this, we can take a *spectrum*, meaning that we split the light into its component colors or wavelengths. This is what a prism does when it makes a rainbow out of sunlight: it splits up light from the Sun into all of the visible colors from red to violet, as shown below. \n",
    "\n",
    "![figure2](images/prismcolors.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to sunlight, when we collect the light from a star or a galaxy and spread it out, we can study how bright something is at each wavelength: a.k.a., its spectrum. Analyzing the spectrum of an object tells us a lot of information: its temperature, what it's made of, how fast it's moving, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How Do we Get so Much Information from a Spectrum?\n",
    "When we split up the light coming from a light bulb (for example) and look at its spectrum, it looks like a smooth rainbow, like the top panel of the figure below, where the x-axis is wavelength in nanometers. But, if you take hydrogen gas, super heat it/shock into a glowing plasma, and take a spectrum of the glowing hydrogen, it will look like the bottom panel of the figure below, with light only showing up at very specific wavelengths.\n",
    "\n",
    "![figure3](images/spectrum.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "These features at specific wavelengths are called *emission lines*. Each chemical element gives off light at particular wavelengths when its atoms get excited (like in a hot plasma), so these lines act like a fingerprint that tells us which elements are present. You can see examples below of emission lines coming from other elements, acting as unique \"fingerprints\" for each element.\n",
    "\n",
    "![figure4](images/element_spectra.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## What Produces Emission Lines in a Galaxy?\n",
    "Hot plasma may not be common here on Earth, but it is quite common in galaxies! Emission lines in galaxies are mostly produced by clouds of gas and plasma that are being energized by nearby sources of energy, usually ultraviolet light, x-rays, or collisions. These gas clouds are part of the interstellar medium (ISM), which fills the space between stars. We will elaborate on this in the next section.\n",
    "\n",
    "Young, hot stars can heat the surrounding hydrogen gas and cause it to glow, producing strong hydrogen emission lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exploding stars (supernovae), stellar winds, and supermassive black holes (AGN) can also energize the gas and influence the shape of the spectrum.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is the Interstellar Medium (ISM)?\n",
    "You may have heard that space is a vacuum, but this isn't completely true. The reason that people say this is because, compared to Earth's atmosphere, the matter in space is *extremely* diffuse. To give you an idea of how diffuse this gas is, Earth's atmosphere has roughly $10^{19}$ particles per cubic centimeter. In many regions of the ISM, you will typically find $10^2 - 10^4$ particles per cubic centimeter. In other words, the Earth's atmosphere can be up to **one hundred thousand trillion** times denser than the ISM! And yet, even though it is widely spread out, there is so much material in the ISM that it emits enormous amounts of light when it is energized.\n",
    "\n",
    "The interstellar medium is made of gas (mostly hydrogen and helium) and dust that fills the space between stars in a galaxy, and it plays a very important role in galaxy evolution. New stars form out of this gas, and the deaths of stars return energy and elements back into the medium. When the gas in the ISM is heated or ionized, it produces *emission lines*, just like the ones shown in the images above.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Redshift ($z$) and the Expanding Universe?\n",
    "We have known since the 1920s that the universe is expanding, which means that distant galaxies appear to be moving away from us. When light from a distant galaxy is emitted, it travels towards the Earth through the expanding Universe, and this causes the light waves to become stretched out, like a slinky. This effect causes the entire spectrum to \"shift\" toward redder colors and is known as **redshift**. The more distant a galaxy is, the more that its light is \"redshifted\". You can see this effect in the image below. By measuring how much the light is redshifted, astronomers can determine how far away a galaxy is and learn about the history and expansion of the universe.\n",
    "\n",
    "![figure5](images/Measuring_Distance_With_Redshift.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Observed Wavelength and Redshift\n",
    "\n",
    "When we observe a distant, \"redshifted\" galaxy's spectrum, we see that the wavelengths of its emission lines are at redder (larger) wavelengths compared to where they would appear in a laboratory. This **redshift** ($z$) is calculated by relating the **observed wavelength** $\\lambda_{\\text{obs}}$ to the **rest-frame (original/laboratory) wavelength** $\\lambda_{\\text{rest}}$ using the equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\lambda_{\\text{obs}} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest}} (1 + z)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, we see an image showing how a galaxy's spectrum changes depending on its redshift, or how far away it is. See any emission lines that look familiar in the top panel? (*Hint: Look at the Hydrogen emission line spectrum in one of the images above.*)\n",
