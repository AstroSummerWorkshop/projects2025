    "# Goal of this project\n",
    "\n",
    "Kepler's laws don't just apply to our solar system, they can be applied to almost any object that is bounded by gravity to another object... for example, like a star orbiting a supermassive black hole! Kepler's 3rd law has the following form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2 a^3}{GM}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "*Breaking down this equation:*\n",
    "\n",
    "- $P$ is the period of orbit, i.e., how much time it takes a star to make 1 revolution around a supermassive black hole. It has units of time, like years or seconds.\n",
    "- $a$ is the semi-major axis of the orbit. For a nearly circular orbit, this is essentially just how far the star is from the supermassive black hole. It has units of distance, like AU or km.\n",
    "- $M$ is the total mass of the system in question (i.e. the mass of the star + the mass of the supermassive black hole). However, often times we can ignore the mass of the smaller object and only consider the mass of the supermassive black hole and still get a really good answer! It has units of mass, like kilograms (kg) or solar-masses ($M_{\\odot} = 2.0 \\times 10^{30}~kg$)\n",
    "- $G$ is the gravitational constant which is $G = 6.67 \\times 10 ^{-11}~\\frac{N}{kg^2 m^2}$, where *N* are called Newtons (units of force) and *m* are meters (units of distance, like km). \\\\\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way of expressing this equation is in terms of *velocity*, how far the star travels per unit time (so the units are distance/time, like km/s). We can do this by plugging in the following definition for period by assuming a circular orbit:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P = \\frac{2\\pi a}{v}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Plugging this in gives:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$v = \\sqrt{\\frac{GM}{a}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally re-arranging this a bit to solve for Mass of the supermassive black hole gives:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$M = \\frac{av^2}{G}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "*Optional: derive this yourself!*\n",
    "\n",
    "**The goal of this project is to obtain an estimate for the mass of the supermassive blackhole at the center of the Milky-Way Galaxy by measuring the motion/velocity of stars near it!**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenge 1: getting through the dust\n",
    "\n",
    "The galactic center is ~20,000 light years from Earth (or 8,200 parsecs) hiding behind thick dust and gas that makes seeing this region in\n",
    "\"ordinary\" light nearly impossible (e.g. the light our eyes can see). Only about 1 in every million visible light photons makes it through the dust. To solve this, astronomers look in the *infrared*, which is less susceptible to dust and thus 1 in every 10 photons makes it through the dust!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenge 2: stars are tiny that far away\n",
    "\n",
    "At distances of 8,200 parsecs, common stars look pretty tiny. If we are to find the mass of the black hole at the center of the galaxy, we need to be able to observe how these tiny stars move around it. To solve this, astronomers have utilized the largest telescope operating today: Keck telescopes. These telescopes are 10-m class telescopes, so their primary mirror is about the size of a tennis court! The larger your telescope, the smaller things you are able to see (i.e., better resolution).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenge 3: what to do about the atmosphere\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking through the atmosphere with such a large telescope is like looking through the water of a fast moving turbulent river. Light interacts with air in a similar way as it does with water. Our atmosphere is very turbulent, highly variable, and thus affects light differently in every instance. If we are to trust in our measurements of stars, we need to ensure the atmosphere isn't introducing errors. To solve this, astronomers have utilized *adaptive optics*, a technique that corrects the distorted incoming light by using a deformable mirror!"

    "### Some final notes\n",
    "CONGRATS! You did it! The mass you found here should be on the order of a million solar masses. That's really big. The methods that we used here are similar in concept to the methods used in the official paper that discovered this object: https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/306528/pdf (although our approach was much more crude). We should note some things about our result:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. This is technically the \"mass enclosed\", not the actual mass of the supermassive black hole. What that means is that the mass within the distance we chose (a) includes the supermassive black hole, but also other things that we might not see currently, like smaller fainter stars, or other weird objects that influence gravity. **Nonetheless, something big is in a small region of space!**\n",
    "\n",
    "2. We found the *transverse* velocity of the star, **not the total velocity**. The transverse velocity is its velocity across the plane of the sky. This star could very well be moving *towards or away from us too!* (i.e., line of sight velocity). If we took this into account, our answer would probably change a bit. However, we obtained a pretty close result anyways! (**How could we measure the line of sight velocity of these stars using other methods discussed in this workshop? Discuss with a partner)**\n",
    "\n",
    "3. We assumed that the orbit of this star was nearly circular, which as we learned from the beginning, isn't really true. In fact, some of these stars orbit at very high eccentricites! In order to get a more accurate estimate of the mass, we would have to consider many more things about the star's orbital motion in addition to its period and semi-major axis (**What are some things about the orbit we did not consider? Discuss with a partner)**\n"
